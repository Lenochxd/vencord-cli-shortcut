## Motivation

I created this project out of laziness to avoid manually checking and updating Vencord CLI every time Discord breaks my installation. All credits for Vencord go to [Vendicated](https://github.com/Vendicated) on GitHub. This software was also made as a learning exercise for publishing a package on Winget, which I plan to do for WebDeck later.
